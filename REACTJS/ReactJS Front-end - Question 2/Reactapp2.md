# React To-Do List App

This repository contains a simple to-do list application implemented in React. The application allows users to add and delete items from the list.

## Usage

1. Enter an item in the input field.
2. Click the "Add Item" button to add the item to the to-do list.
3. To delete an item, click the "Delete" button next to the item.

## Implementation Details

The to-do list application uses React hooks to manage state and handle user actions. The `useState` hook is used to maintain the list of items and the input field's value. The `addItem` function adds a new item to the list if it is not empty. The `deleteItem` function removes an item from the list based on its index.

Feel free to explore and use this simple to-do list application as a starting point for your own projects!
